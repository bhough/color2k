> a color parsing and manipulation lib served in 2kB or less (1.5kB to be more precise)

color2k is a color parsing and manipulation library with the objective of keeping the bundle size as small as possible.

The bundle size is [currently 1.5kB](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=color2k)

## Installation

```
npm i --save color2k
```

If you need to server-side render any colors, you also need to install the node/ssr compatibility package.

```bash
# only needed in SSR environments (e.g. gatsby, next.js)
npm i --save @color2k/node
```

## Usage

```js
import { darken, transparentize } from 'color2k';

// e.g.
darken('blue', 0.1);
transparentize('red', 0.5);
```

You can also chain together color functions with `vary`:

```js
import { darken, transparentize, vary } from 'color2k';

vary('red', [
  [darken, 0.1],
  [transparentize, 0.1],
]);
```

## How so small?

There are two secrets that keep this lib especially small:

1. defer to the browser to [parse colors via canvas](https://github.com/ricokahler/color2k/blob/23589d4c6a9dc281d111f35bc2058a3fbf1bd805/packages/parse-to-rgba/src/index.ts#L63)
2. small API footprint ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Credits

Heavy credits goes to polished.js and sass. Much of the implementation of this lib is copied from polished!
